## Personal Summary

I am a senior systems engineer with a number of years experience providing consultancy and systems architecture services to a wide range of organisations across industries that include cloud computing, mass-market web hosting, genetic research and retail.

I have spent the last 12 months providing advice and systems engineering services to HP Cloud Services (HPCS) including designing logging and backup strategies to be deployed across 4,000 servers using Chef & Bacula, working on a key part of the development and testing environment for the Openstack Nova engineers and creating wallboards to show critical data within both the Technical Operations and Nova Compute systems engineering teams.

Prior to providing these services to HPCS, I designed and installed a desktop configuration policy deployment system for LOVEFiLM based on Cobbler and Puppet that was suitable for all staff that chose not to run Windows as their primary operating system.  This included creating puppet manifests that were able to run on Ubuntu, Fedora and MacOS X.

I have also designed and implemented systems capable of handling hundreds of thousands of websites and email accounts split across multiple datacentres in a way that enabled hardware replacement with zero downtime.

I have an excellent track record in advising on and implementing DevOps-related toolchains and processes, including speaking at a number of events on the subject, and I have an in-depth knowledge of PCI Compliance.

## Employment History

__Green and Secure IT Limited__

_December 2011 - Present_

Green and Secure is my own business providing consultancy and contract system administration services to large organisations based around continuous integration and "DevOps".

Clients to date have included LOVEFiLM and HP Cloud Services (HPCS) each of which have engaged me for my systems configuration experience.

I have also delivered talks on DevOps and how to implement continuous integration for system configurations to the UK Unix User Group and Unified Diff -  a Cardiff-based organisation for local developers and systems administrators to exchange best practice.

__Namesco Limited__

Cluster Manager

_April 2009 - December 2011_

This role included management of people, processes and systems underpinning the primary business focus of Mass Shared Hosting.

Achievements included:

  1. Implementing Continuous Integration of System Configurations through the use of Jenkins, Puppet, Cobbler and custom code (since release as "cucumber-libvirt" through my GitHub account)
  2. Reducing server build times from a manual build of up to 7 hours down to an automated build of 8 minutes
  3. Complete analysis and overhaul of the email storage backend, moving from RAMSAN to FusionIO and DRBD
  4. Complete analysis and overhaul of the code deployment process for in-house development practices, reducing the time to deploy from 2 hours to under three minutes
  5. Migration of all in-house services from Zeus Web Server to new hardware running Nginx and PHP-FPM delivering a 4-fold increase in speed.
  6. PCI Compliance across a legacy system through a redesign of the network and working with developers to alter the approach taken to accessing the systems.
  7. Design and implementation of a bespoke CMDB to replace cobbler with a complete node management solution

__Freelance Consultant/Engineer__

_September 2008 - January 2009_

This role was my first foray into self-employment and revolved around the design, development and implementation of a bespoke content management system for a client.

The code allowed the client to create a library of documents based on a number of formats and then allow their customers to search based on keywords to retrieve articles of interest.

The system was based upon a standard LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) web application stack.

__Tiger Computing Limited__

Technical Consultant

_January 2008 - September 2008_

This role involved working with clients to collect deliverable targets across a wide range of industries including retail, computer services and bio-technologies in order to provide the best possible solution to the issues that our customers faced whilst ensuring that the projects were within budget.

Key projects included the design and implementation of a shared hosting cluster, the implementation of a backup system and installation configuration of a linux-based web-proxy/firewall authenticating against Microsoft Active Directory.

__CARISS__

Technical Manager

_July 2007 - January 2008_

This role involved consultancy, sales and management for a small firm based in the south-east of England.

Products that were implemented included ERP solutions based on Adempiere, website solutions based on both bespoke code and Joomla and CCTV solutions.

__Fujifilm Sericol__

__ADP Kerridge International Dealer Systems__

Support Engineer

_October 2005 - June 2006_

It also involved remote troubleshooting of physical hardware including printers and PCs.

_November 2001 - October 2005_

These four years were spent exploring other career options including Healthcare.  This improved my transferable skills including documentation and social interaction, however it was not for me and helped me to understand that I should be working in the IT sector.

__ePresence Limited/Banyan Systems__

Systems Administrator

_October 2000 - November 2001_

This role was my first on leaving full-time education  and involved supporting a windows network of 15 users with support from head office in the United States.

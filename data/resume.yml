mission_statement: "I am a senior systems engineer with a number of years experience providing consultancy and systems architecture services to a wide range of organisations across industries that include cloud computing, mass-market web hosting, genetic research and retail.

I have spent the last 12 months providing advice and systems engineering services to HP Cloud Services (HPCS) including designing logging and backup strategies to be deployed across 4,000 servers using Chef & Bacula, working on a key part of the development and testing environment for the Openstack Nova engineers and creating wallboards to show critical data within both the Technical Operations and Nova Compute systems engineering teams.

Prior to providing these services to HPCS, I designed and installed a desktop configuration policy deployment system for LOVEFiLM based on Cobbler and Puppet that was suitable for all staff that chose not to run Windows as their primary operating system. This included creating puppet manifests that were able to run on Ubuntu, Fedora and MacOS X.

I have also designed and implemented systems capable of handling hundreds of thousands of websites and email accounts split across multiple datacentres in a way that enabled hardware replacement with zero downtime.

I have an excellent track record in advising on and implementing DevOps-related toolchains and processes, including speaking at a number of events on the subject, and I have an in-depth knowledge of PCI Compliance."
